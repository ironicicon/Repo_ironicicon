What is favoritism granted in politics or business to relatives?	Nepotism	Academicism	Capitalism	Immanentism


The above are categories we have used in the past.    You can use these, or come up with your own.

Please omit any & # @ ^ * characters from the file.  Also, don't include currency, so $20 should say 20 Dollars, and M&M's should be M and M's.  Periods, commas, quotes, question marks, exclamation points are all fine.

Risque questions are fine, but no R or X-rated content please.

Lastly, have fun with the content.  A funny answer per round is always appreciated.  For example:

What color is the sky?  Blue, Pink, Green, 7

What's funny about that, is 7 is not a color, making things a little funny, but don't do more than 1 funny answer per round of 31 questions.

If you have any questions, just let me know!

Have a great day!

Hi Ram,

It is up to you.  You can choose to use any of the categories we have used in the past, or make new categories, or a combination of the 2.

Each set should have 6 unique categories.  Please don't repeat the same category in the same set, but it is ok to have 2 "Misc" categories in the same set, but don't call both categories "Misc".  Use synonymous terms like:  Misc, Potpourri, This and That, Hodgepodge, A Little of Everything.

The only thing that matters the most is accurate spelling, punctuation, grammar, accurate questions/answers, and have fun with them.

thanks!
tom
